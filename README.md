# Sager Drone Tracking - Technical Task

App is deployed at: https://laithtawabini.github.io/sager-drone-tracker-front/

Please make sure to have a running local websocket server at port 9013

Make sure to also provide the public token for Mapbox

## Notes

I have used React with TS and Vite as a base

For UI and styling i have used Tailwind css mainly and some Shadcn components

The map component may be overwhelming and can definatly be better written or refactored, but i have added comments above every useEffect to hopefully make it more clear and readable

I have used github copilot extension in vscode as an assistant while building this project, but with care, each AI generated line was reviewed before i added it

Thats it, enjoy!
